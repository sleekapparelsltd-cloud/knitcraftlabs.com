## Week 2: Educational Content & Expertise

### Day 8 - LinkedIn Post (Educational)
**Caption:**
"🧵 MANUFACTURING INSIGHT: What's the real difference between MOQ 50 vs 1000 pieces?

For fashion startups, this choice can make or break your business:

MOQ 1000+ pieces:
❌ High upfront investment ($15,000-50,000)
❌ Risk of overstock
❌ Limited design testing
❌ Cash flow challenges

MOQ 50-300 pieces (KnitCraft Labs):
✅ Lower risk investment ($2,500-15,000)
✅ Test market demand first
✅ Perfect for seasonal collections
✅ Sustainable growth approach

We've seen countless startups succeed by starting small and scaling smart.

What's your experience with MOQ challenges?
