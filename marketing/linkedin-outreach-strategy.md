Hi [First Name],

This success story reminded me of our conversation:

A Swedish fashion startup came to us needing 75 custom hoodies for their launch event. Other manufacturers required 500+ minimums, but we delivered exactly what they needed in 18 days.

They sold out at their launch and are now planning larger production runs with us.

This is exactly why we started KnitCraft Labs - to help brands start smart and scale when ready.

Thought you'd appreciate the story! How are things going with [Company Name]?

🧵 MANUFACTURING MYTH: "Low MOQ always means higher prices"

Reality check: It depends on your total volume and relationship.

Here's what actually affects your per-unit cost:

1️⃣ Setup complexity (simple designs scale better)
2️⃣ Fabric type (standard vs custom)
3️⃣ Timeline flexibility (rush orders cost more)
4️⃣ Repeat business potential

At KnitCraft Labs, our 50-piece customers often get better rates than 500-piece one-time orders because of relationship value.

The key? Find manufacturers who understand your business model.

What's been your experience with MOQ pricing?

#### 2. Success Stories
**Example:**
```
CLIENT SPOTLIGHT 🌟

Challenge: Finnish school needed 120 uniform blazers with 2-week deadline
Previous supplier: 4-week minimum timeline

Our solution:
✅ Express production using stock fabric
✅ Custom school embroidery
✅ Delivered in 12 days
✅ 30% cost savings vs local suppliers

Result: Happy students, satisfied administrators, and ongoing partnership for all uniform needs.

This is why we love working with Nordic schools - quality standards that match our own commitment to excellence.

School administrators: Planning for next academic year? Let's talk early to avoid rush situations.

```

#### 3. Industry Insights
**Example:**
```
📊 FASHION STARTUP TREND ALERT:

67% of new fashion brands are launching with under 200 pieces per style.

Why the shift to smaller batches?

• Less upfront capital required
• Faster market validation
• Reduced inventory risk
• Ability to test multiple designs

But here's the challenge: Most manufacturers still require 500+ pieces.

This creates a massive opportunity gap for suppliers who can adapt to modern business models.

At KnitCraft Labs, 80% of our clients start with sub-300 piece orders. Many scale to thousands once they prove market fit.

The future of manufacturing is flexibility, not just scale.

What's your take on this trend?
